<p>Implement a monster game to practice using classes and asynchronus Javascript code. Practice using and creating class methods and constructors, as well as importing and exporting code modules. I learned a lot about how instances of classes work, and how asynchronus code works. I also learned how to use class methods, and how valuable they can be to be attached to a class instance. The biggest thing I learned from this project was how to read and break down someone elses code so that I can understand and build upon it.</p>
